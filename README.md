# Final_Project_MachineLearning


This code and the project is created for a mandatory project ACIT4630 Advanced machine learning and deep learning (https://student.oslomet.no/en/studier/-/studieinfo/emne/ACIT4630/2022/HÃ˜ST) Master course at Oslo Metropolitan university. The data set for this project is taken from the link (https://drive.google.com/open?id=1gqS1fkTvtuAaKj_0cn9n04ng1qDAoZ2t) 


## Project Titile "Fall detection using wearable sensor" 
## Problem Definition
Automatic fall detection (FD) devices have been developed as assertive technology throughout the last two decades. The primary purpose of fall detection systems is to detect critical falls and warn medical professionals or carers as soon as possible. Furthermore, these solutions can help the elderly and carers cope with psychological stress. Basically the problem to be solved is to distinguish fall from activities of daily life by using a wireless sensor fitted to the persons body. There are various types of fall action on the dataset and the task is to identify some of the non fall actions which are high impact events with falls. For this, we used machine learning classifiers to train the dataset and predit the fall activities by using Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and a deep neural network (LSTM, CNN+LSTM).
